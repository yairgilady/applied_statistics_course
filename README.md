### Zoom link
Link for zoom explaing the code: https://drive.google.com/file/d/168oawDlw9GoTKjNUgk2Tp8BZvvWIBsBV/view

Disclaimer: since we only had 40 on zoom meeting, we had to speed things up. I strongly advice not to rely on the recording and just read the comments on the code.


### instruction: 
In this repository We added six jupyter notebooks, each corresponding with every lecture (the two lectures of bayesians analisys is combined into one). 
You can open it on your machine (prefferably in juypter lab) and look at our results.
